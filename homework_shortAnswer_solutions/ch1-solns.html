<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1: What is an Operating System?</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> 1.1
  What are the two main functions of an operating system?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  An operating system provides the users with an extended (i.e.,
  virtual) machine, and it must manage the I/O devices and other system
  resources.</p>

<h2>1.2: History</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
  What is multiprogramming?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Multiprogramming is the rapid switching of the CPU between multiple processes
  in memory. It is commonly used to keep the CPU busy while one or more
  processes are doing I/O. It also allows two or more people to use the same
  computer simultaneously. Furthermore, it permits a single user to start up
  multiple, independent processed at the same time.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
  Why was timesharing not widespread on second generation computers?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Second generation computers did not have the necessary hardware to protect
  the operating system from malicious user programs.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
  What is spooling?
  Do you think that advanced personal computers will have spooling as
  a standard feature in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Input spooling is the technique of
  reading jobs, onto the disk, so that when the currently executing
  processed are finished, there will be work waiting for the CPU.
  Output spooling consists of first copying printable files to disk
  before printing them, rather thatn printing directly as the output
  is generated.
  Input spooling on a personal computer is not very likely since the
  jobs are normally created on the disk, but output spooling is.</p>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> 1.5.
  On early computers, every byte of data read or written was handled
  by the CPU (i.e., there was no DMA).
  What implications does this have for multiprogramming?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  It makes multiprogramming less favorable since it is no longer the
  case that when one process does I/O the CPU is completely free to
  work on other processes.</p>

<h2>1.5 Operating Systems Concepts</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> 1.12.
  Which of the following instructions should be allowed only in kernel
  mode?</p>
<ol type=a>
  <li>Disable all interrupts.</li>
  <li>Read the time-of-day clock.</li>
  <li>Set the time-of-day clock.</li>
  <li>Change the memory map.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Choices (a),(c) and (d) should be restricted to kernel mode.</p>

<h2>1.6: System Calls</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
  For each of the following system calls,
  give a condition that causes it to fail: <strong>fork</strong>,
  <strong>exec</strong>, and <strong>unlink</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  <strong>Fork</strong> can fail if there are no free slots left in
  the process table (and possibly if there is no memory or swap space
  left).<br/>
  <strong>Exec</strong> can fail if the file name given does not exist
  or is not a valid executable file.<br />
  <strong>Unlink</strong> can fail if the file to be unlinked does not
  exist or the calling process does not have the authority to unlink
  it.</p>

<h2>1.7: OS Structure</h2>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> 1.24.
  The client-server model is popular in distributed systems.
  Can it also be used in single-computer system?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Yes it can, especially if the kernel is a message passing system.
  Also the client-server paradigm is often used to split large programs
  into a more modular, flexible, extendable, etc. system.  Even
  traditional monolithic OSs have various applications using
  client-server: X Windows for Unix/Linux is a good example.</p>
