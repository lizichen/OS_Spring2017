<h1>Chapter 6: Deadlocks</h1>

<h2>6.2: Deadlocks</h2>

<p><strong>Problem 6.9:</strong>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Yes illegal graphs exist.
  We stated that a resource may only be held by a single process.
  An arc from a resource square to a process circle indicates that the
  process owns the resource.
  Thus a square with arcs going from it to two or more processes means
  that all those process hold the resource, which violates the rules.
  Consequently, any graph in which multiple arcs leave a square and
  end in different circles violates the rules [This is for single unit
  resources.
  For multiple unit resources you can have multiple arcs leaving a
  square, which represents a resource type; the dots inside a square
  represent the resources instances themselves.
  Arcs from squares to squares or from circles to circles are
  definitely not possible and a graph awith such an arc violates the
  rules.</p>

<h2>6.6: Deadlock Prevention</h2>

<p><strong>Problem 10:</strong>
  Consider Figure 6-4.
  Suppose that in step (o) C requested S instead of requesting R.
  Would this lead to deadlock?
  Suppose that it requested both S and R.
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Neither change leads to deadlock. There is no circular wait in either
  case.</p>

<h2>6.5: Deadlock Avoidance</h2>

<p><strong>Problem 17:</strong>
  All the trajectories in Figure 6-8 are horizontal or vertical.
  Is is possible for a trajectory to be a diagonal.
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  If the system had two or more CPUs, two or more processes could run in
  parallel, leading to diagonal trajectories.<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem 18:</strong> 
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Yes. Do the whole thing in three dimensions. The z-axis measures the
  number of instructions executed by the third process.<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem 19:</strong>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  The method can only be used to guide the scheduling if the exact
  instant at which a resource is going to be claimed is known in
  advance. In practice, this is rarely the case.<hr/>

<p><strong>Problem 21:</strong> 
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
  Satisfying a request from D is unsafe, but satisfying one from C is
  safe.<hr/>

<p><strong>Homework:</strong> Consider a system containing a total of
  12 units of resource R and 24 units of resource S managed by the
  banker's algorithm.
  There are three processes P1, P2, and P3.
  P1's claim is 0 units of R and 12 units of S, written (0,12).
  P2's claim is (8,15).
  P3's claim is (8,20).
  Currently P1 has 4 units of S, P2 has 8 units of R, P3 has 8 units
  of S, and there are no outstanding requests.
  <ol class="compact">
    <li>What is the largest number of units of S that P1 can request
      at this point that the banker will grant?
    <li>If P2 instead of P1 makes the request, what is the largest
      number of units of S that the banker will grant?
    <li>If P3 instead of P1 or P2 makes the request, what is the
      largest number of units of S that the banker will grant?
  </ol>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: There are (8,12) allocated in total and
  hence (4,12) available.
  <table class="right">
    <tr>
      <th>process<th>initial<br>claim<th>current<br>alloc<th>might<br>need
    </tr>
    <tr><td>P1<td>(0,12)<td>(0,4)<td>(0,8)</tr>
    <tr><td>P2<td>(8,15)<td>(8,0)<td>(0,15)</tr>
    <tr><td>P3<td>(8,20)<td>(0,8)<td>(8,12)</tr>
  </table>
  <ol>
    <li>It would be legal to give up to 8 units of S to P1.
      For each value i from 1 to 8 giving i units to P1 results in a
      safe system because the processes can be serviced in the order
      P1, P2, and P3 and be guaranteed to finish.<br>
      Hence the answer is 8.
    <li>It would be legal to give up to 12 units of S to P2.
      For i from 1 to 4 it would be safe to give i units to
      P2 since, AFTER giving the i units, the processes could again be
      serviced in the order P1, P2, P3 and all will finish.<br>
      However if 5 units are given P2, the avail would become
      (4,7), which is not enough to finish any process, let alone all
      of them in some order.<br>
      Thus the answer is 4.
    <li>It would be legal to give up to 12 units of S to P3.
      If one unit is given the avail is (4,11), and system is safe
      since the processes can be serviced in the order P1, P2, P3 and
      be guaranteed to finish.<br>
      However, if 2 units are given, the avail is (4,10).
      Although this is enough to finish P1, the avail is then (4,14),
      which is not enough to finish either P2 or P3.<br>
      Hence the answer is 1.
